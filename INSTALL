Simply run the run.sh script with the apk file or apk files directory (to run as a batch) as the argument.
We have provided some apps (27) in the Apps folder to run. These apps are mentioned in table 9 of the paper.

Command:

./run.sh <apk_file> or <apk_files directory> 
Example:
./run.sh Apps/com.dunkinbrands.otgo.apk

Output: leak signatures generated in a .txt file in same location as run.sh script

Example: Output for com.dunkinbrands.otgo.apk

IMEI +  (Third Party Leak)
+ IMEI  + AndroidID (Third Party Leak)
h(IMEI) +  (Third Party Leak)
( AndroidID ^ h(SerialNo) ^ h(IMEI) ) + GUID (Third Party Leak)
+ GUID (Third Party Leak)
AndroidID +  (Third Party Leak)
( SerialNo ^ AndroidID ) + GUID (Own Code Leak)
+ AndroidID (Third Party Leak)
h(SerialNo) +  (Third Party Leak)
SerialNo +  (Third Party Leak)
Mac +  (Own Code Leak)
Adv +  (Third Party Leak)
GUID +  (Third Party Leak)
GUID +  (Own Code Leak)



These are the leak signatures generated.
Each line of the output represents a unique leak signature for the app. 
For example 
( AndroidID ^ h(SerialNo) ^ h(IMEI) ) + GUID (Third Party Leak)
means either a combination of hashed SerialNo, hashed IMEI and raw AndroidID or only GUID is leaked. This leak is third party leak.
